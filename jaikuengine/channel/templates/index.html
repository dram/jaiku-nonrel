      Channels are a way for multiple people to post to the same stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      To start posting to a channel, go to its page, click Join, and type your message in the 
      field that appears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Channels allow you to separate conversations, because messages posted to a channel are not 
      displayed on your personal stream. If you think your followers should 
      follow the topic, tell them to join the channel!

    Joining channels created by others can be fun. We recommend that you start by joining <a href="/channel/{{SUPPORT_CHANNEL}}">#{{SUPPORT_CHANNEL}}</a> to get support and share ideas about improving {{SITE_NAME}}.
